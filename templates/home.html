            <h2>Game Instructions</h2>
            <p>Bingo is a 2 player game which has so many versions. The instructions for this version are given below:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Create a board with 5 rows and 5 columns which have numbers from 1-25 placed randomly.</p>
                    <pre>
Note:
    Each player must hide their board throughout the game until finish.
    Player1's board may or may not be the same as player2's board.
                    </pre>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Player1 will tell a number which is not marked in the board, then both players mark that number in their board.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Player2 will tell a number which is not marked in the board, then both players mark that number in their board.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Repeat steps 2 and 3 until someone wins.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>If every number in a row, column, or diagonal is marked, the player gets a point which is represented as 'B I N G O'.</p>
                    <pre>
Example:
Given board =
[
    ["█", "█", "█", "█", "█"],
    [13 , 15 , 20 , "█", "█" ],
    [11 , 12 , "█", 14 , "█"],
    [16 , "█", 18 , 19 , "█"],
    ["█", 22 , 23 , 24 , "█"],
]
Here, the player with this board gets 3 points (1 row, 1 col, 1 diagonal)
which is represented as 'B I N'.
                    </pre>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Whoever gets 5 points AKA 'B I N G O' first WINS.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
