# Mallu-Bingo

## Description
Sometimes, classes can feel a bit dull, and that‚Äôs when I turn to my favorite paper games! One game I absolutely love is "Bingo." It's a simple yet strategic paper game that brings a spark of excitement to the day. Whether I'm playing with friends or competing to see who can get to that magical "Bingo!" first, it always adds a fun twist to the usual routine.

In the old days, every kid's notebook had a special space dedicated to playing Bingo, making it a beloved pastime that brightened our school days. Those moments of friendly competition and laughter created memories that still make me smile! This game is especially popular among the "Useless Backbench Team," who always find a way to turn the most boring classes into a lively competition.


## Game Instructions

Bingo is a 2 player game which has so many versions. The instructions for this version are given below:

1. Create a board with 5 rows and 5 columns which have numbers from 1-25 placed randomly.  
   **Note:** Each player must hide their board throughout the game until finish. Player 1's board may or may not be the same as player 2's board.

2. Player 1 will tell a number which is not marked in the board, then both players mark that number in their board.

3. Then, Player 2 will tell a number which is not marked in the board, then both players mark that number in their board.

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until someone wins.

5. If every number in a row, column, or diagonal is marked, the player gets a point which is represented as 'B I N G O'.  
   **Example:** Given board:
   ```python
   [
       ["‚ñà", "‚ñà", "‚ñà", "‚ñà", "‚ñà"],
       [13, 15, 20, "‚ñà", "‚ñà"],
       [11, 12, "‚ñà", 14, "‚ñà"],
       [16, "‚ñà", 18, 19, "‚ñà"],
       ["‚ñà", 22, 23, 24, "‚ñà"],
   ]
   Here, the player with this board gets 3 points (1 row, 1 column, 1 diagonal), which is represented as 'B I N'.

6. `"Whoever gets 5 points AKA 'B I N G O' first WINS!"`
