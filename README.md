## üí¨ Game Instructions

Bingo is a 2 player game which has so many versions. The instructions for this version are given below:

1. Create a board with 5 rows and 5 columns which have numbers from 1-25 placed randomly.  
   **Note:** Each player must hide their board throughout the game until finish. Player 1's board may or may not be the same as player 2's board.

2. Player 1 will tell a number which is not marked in the board, then both players mark that number in their board.

3. Then, Player 2 will tell a number which is not marked in the board, then both players mark that number in their board.

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until someone wins.

5. If every number in a row, column, or diagonal is marked, the player gets a point which is represented as 'B I N G O'.  
   **Example:** Given board:
   ```python
   [
       ["‚ñà", "‚ñà", "‚ñà", "‚ñà", "‚ñà"],
       [13, 15, 20, "‚ñà", "‚ñà"],
       [11, 12, "‚ñà", 14, "‚ñà"],
       [16, "‚ñà", 18, 19, "‚ñà"],
       ["‚ñà", 22, 23, 24, "‚ñà"],
   ]
   Here, the player with this board gets 3 points (1 row, 1 column, 1 diagonal), which is represented as 'B I N'.

6. `"Whoever gets 5 points AKA 'B I N G O' first WINS!"`
